# Polynomial-Calculator
A polynomial calculator with basic operations using Java and MVC pattern.I used Regex to find the conefficient and the exponent from text
I used Junit for testing
How to use:
Give 2 polynomials (if you want to add/substract or multiply) and then elect the operation
The form should nrX^power : 3X^2+3X^0 (for the ffree term use X^0 instead of blank space)
